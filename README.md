## currently working on (5/9/21):
###### General
- [ ] Element alignments: for all views, check padding, margins. Some pixels sometimes slightly off.
- [ ] Check responsive display on very large screens
- [ ] Refactor Tailwind elements. Currently too repetitive.
- [ ] Custom 404 page
- [ ] Take care of routing (ie, if you land on /about, it gives you a 404)
- [ ] DRY up areas where repetition is present

###### Main/home
- [ ] Add firefly field with Three.JS
- [ ] Name display: don't center within the div; new characters should display in place
- [ ] setTimeOut secondary text so it shows after last character
- [ ] Experiment with rectangle position
- [ ] Experiment with color scheme; add some interest

###### Navbar
- [ ] In some views, the top nav doesn't span width. Correct this.
- [ ] Make the bg not black
- [ ] Icons too far apart
- [ ] Icons should not jump when hovered

###### Projects

- [ ] Split into programming and UX sections more clearly.
